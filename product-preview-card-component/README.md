## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox Layout
- CSS / HTML5

### What I learned

The tranform css property is extremely useful and time saving for trying to scale div's and everything within it.

### Continued development

Trying to determine which div to scale in terms of width and height when dealing with images and div containers containg images. Also,
I'm not entirely sure on things like max-width vs width and how it affects images.
